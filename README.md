# CHORN - Python Development

This CHORN's repository showcases two parallel implementations of a simple CRUD posts API using FastAPI and Flask frameworks.

## Fast API Framework

* **`fastapi_service/`** → A FastAPI-based service using SQLAlchemy and Pydantic, structured with repositories,
  services, and routers.

## Flask Framework

* **`flask_service/`** → A Flask-based service using SQLAlchemy, Marshmallow, JWT, and caching, organized with
  blueprints, services, and repositories.

The project demonstrates clean architecture, separation of concerns, and best practices for building maintainable,
production-ready Python web APIs.
